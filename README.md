# What's this?

This is the backend server as per assignment parameters. It takes a fixture (`sampledata.js`) that provides data of purchases so that the frontend is able to calculate rewards points. There's not much else to it other than it uses basic express.js routing to send the data out. 

Please note that this server needs to be running on port 8080 for the frontend to function.

# What now?

* `npm i`
* `npm start` or maybe `nodemon start` in case you'd like to change the data on the fly.
